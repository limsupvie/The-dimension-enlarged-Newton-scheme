These codes are implementations of Dimension-enlarged Newton scheme for finding full dimensional quasi-periodic solutions of 1-d undamped Duffing oscillator and 2-d Henon-Heiles system.

## Requirements

- MATLAB

## File structure

The file structure is as follows.

- Duffing
  > main_duffing.m  
  *This is the main program with Dimension-enlarged Newton scheme for 1-d undamped Duffing oscillator.*  

  > Newton_duffing_Solver.m    
  > P_eqn_calcu.m  
  > Q_eqn.m  
  > T_construct.m  
  > Vector_Expand_padding.m  
  > Vectorization_Process.m  
  > Vectorization_Process_Inverse.m  
  *These are functions used in the main program for 1-d undamped Duffing oscillator.*  

- Henon-Heiles
  > main_Henon.m  
  *This is the main program with Dimension-enlarged Newton scheme for 2-d Henon-Heiles system.*  

  > Newton_HH_Solver.m  
  > P_eqn_calcu.m  
  > Q_eqn.m  
  > T_construct.m  
  > Matrix_Expand_padding.m  
  > Vectorization_Process.m  
  > Vectorization_Process_Inverse.m  
  *These are functions used in the main program for 2-d Henon-Heiles system.*
